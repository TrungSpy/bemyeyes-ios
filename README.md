# Getting started
## Install Dependencies
Install pods by running `pod install` in the terminal
If you don't have CocoaPods already, install by `sudo gem install cocoapods`

## Configuration
Rename BMEGlobal.temp.h to BMEGlobal.h and configure to your own needs

## Localization / Translations
The translations are crowd sourced at [crowdin](crowdin.com/project/bemyeyes). Please contribute there, instead of editing the `.string`s files directly in the repo.
